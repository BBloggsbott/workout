# Workout

### What is Workout?

Workout is an API to import and use `OpenAI-Gym`'s environment with `PyTorch` effortlessly

### Why it is required?

`PyTorch`: Flexible framework to implement deep neural networks and has better GPU integration
`OpenAI-Gym`: Provides extensive and varied Reinforcement Learning environments to use readily

However, the integration between two is not very extensive. Many works have been done to implement
deep network based Reinforcement Learning algorithms using `PyTorch` seperately, then transfer the whole control
to `Gym`'s environment to estimate reward function, state of the system, possible actions for next step, etc.,
and pass it again to `PyTorch`'s model. Therefore, to avoid such complications, `Workout` provides a higher level of abstraction to the `Gym`'s environment, providing an interface to make it more `PyTorch` oriented. By doing so,
the users shall effortlessly use `Gym`'s environment without affecting `PyTorch`'s syntactic sugar. Also, the
translation to `PyTorch` codebase would improve the uniformity of the underlying kernel and helps heavily in
parallelization using GPUs.

### How it is done?

`Workout` provides several classes that acts as an interface between `Gym` and `Pytorch`. The package is centered towards Q-Learning. So it will allow users to define their own Policies, Models, preprocessing the inputs to and outputs from the model and define training loops or use the default ones.
